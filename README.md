# 🛡️ Open Risk Framework

> **Modular, Open-Source Risk Management System for AML, Sanctions, Credit Risk, and Operational Risk**

---

## 🚀 Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a robust, modular, and open source risk management framework that empowers organizations to identify, assess, and mitigate operational risks, financial crime, and sanctions violations. By leveraging advanced analytics, AI-driven insights, and a transparent Model Context Protocol (MCP), the framework will foster trust, compliance, and resilience in complex business environments.

This framework is designed to be accessible to a wide range of stakeholders—including risk professionals, compliance teams, data scientists, and developers—enabling them to collaboratively build, customize, and extend risk management solutions tailored to their unique needs. The open source nature of the project promotes transparency, community-driven innovation, and continuous improvement, ensuring that the framework remains aligned with evolving regulatory requirements and industry best practices.

## 🧱 Project Scope
⚙️ Modular Architecture
The framework will be built using a modular design, allowing users to plug in or swap out risk modules (e.g., operational risk, AML, sanctions screening) as needed. This ensures flexibility and scalability for organizations of all sizes.

🔍 Model Context Protocol (MCP)
A core component is the Model Context Protocol, which provides a standardized, machine-readable way to document model metadata, assumptions, data sources, methodologies, and outputs. MCP ensures transparency, reproducibility, and auditability of all risk models deployed within the framework.

📄 Risk Identification and Assessment
The framework will support the ingestion of diverse data sources (transaction logs, process data, regulatory lists) and apply configurable models for risk identification, scoring, and prioritization. Users can define custom risk matrices, thresholds, and business rules to reflect their unique risk profiles.

📦 AI-Driven Insights and Automation
Leveraging AI and machine learning, the framework will enable advanced anomaly detection, predictive analytics, and automated investigation of suspicious activities. This enhances the speed and accuracy of risk detection, while reducing manual effort.

📊 Reporting and Visualization
Users will have access to interactive dashboards and automated reporting tools, making it easy to monitor key risk indicators, generate compliance reports, and communicate findings to stakeholders.

🧠 Compliance and Governance
The framework will embed compliance checks, audit trails, and access controls to help organizations align with regulatory standards (such as NIST AI RMF, GDPR, and AML directives) and internal governance policies.

📚 Collaboration and Community Engagement
As an open source project, the framework encourages contributions from the global risk and compliance community. Comprehensive documentation, contributor guides, and community forums will support onboarding and knowledge sharing.
Designed for integration with existing systems and third-party tools, the framework will offer APIs, connectors, and export/import capabilities, enabling seamless adoption within diverse IT environments.
